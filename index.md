_A living open educational resource, workbook, and workshop._

**Abstract**. AI tools increasingly support all stages of research projects. At the same time, their use is constrained by ethical principles, research-integrity standards, and governance (legal and regulatory) requirements. This workshop introduces these constraints, presents the risks of AI use in research, and provides practical strategies for mitigating them across the entire research lifecycle. Both unintentional harms (AI safety) and deliberate threats (AI security) will be addressed. Participants will learn how to use AI tools safely, securely, and in compliance with ethical, integrity, and governance expectations.

**Target group**. Researchers and research support staff.
