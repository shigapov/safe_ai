## Hands-On Exercise (20 min): For every stage in the research lifecycle

Risk management in every stage
* Pick: one AI use case
* Identify:
   * Multiple ethical risks
   * Multiple integrity risks
   * Multiple governance risks
* Rate severity: low, medium, and high
* Choose multiple treatment strategies: Risk Mitigation, Transfer (to another party), Avoidance (eliminating the source), or Acceptance. In Risk mitigation apply defense in depth to all three dimensions (people, technology, and processes).
* Create: a risk register for your AI use case.
