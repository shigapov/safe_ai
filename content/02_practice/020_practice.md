* Risk management framework adapted to the trinity of risks (ethical, integrity, and governance)
* Hands-On: Use cases of AI and risk management across the research lifecycle. Plan & design, collect & create, analyze & collaborate, evaluate & archive, share & disseminate, access & reuse.
* AI policies and checklists for research groups and research projects
