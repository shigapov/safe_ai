# Research Governance

## Research governance: Who defines that?

* Lawmakers
   * National: German Bundestag and Bundesrat (e.g., BDSG, Urheberrechtsgesetz)
   * European: European Parliament and Council (e.g, GDPR, EU AI Act, CDSM directive)
* Regulator and government agencies (e.g., European Medicines Agency, European Chemicals Agency, and Data Protection Authorities)
* Courts interpret how the law applies

* Institutional Governance Structures (policies, support structures, and processes)
* Contracts (grant agreements, consortium agreements, NDAs, licenses, DSAs, etc.)
* Mechanisms to ensure compliance (procedures and checklists)
